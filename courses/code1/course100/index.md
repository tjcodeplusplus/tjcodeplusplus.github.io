# Course 100 - Discrete Mathematics

Discrete Mathematics is a course required by most prestigous colleges for students majoring in CS. It covers important topics in mathematics for computer science, including asymptotic analysis, combinatorics, graph theory and more.

## Prerequisites

AP Computer Science or equivalent course.

Topics to know:
- Basic Programming (preferably Python)
- Big-O Complexity
- Sorting Algorithms (selection, insertion, bubble, quick, merge, heap)
- Searching Algorithms (linear, binary)
- Data Structures (lists/arrays, stacks, queues, binary trees)
- Precalculus (limits, evaluating functions)

## Course Materials

There are 5 modules.

1. [Module 1 - Logic and Proofs](/module1)
2. Module 2 - Asymptotic Analysis
3. Module 3 - Counting and Probability
4. Module 4 - Graphs
5. Module 5 - Number Theory
