# Courses

This is a new experimental part of the Code++ club where we customly create and curate courses containing information beyond high school CS. All courses are asynchronous and self graded. While it is recommended to go through a course's materials in order, you are free to skip around and read whatever you desire. Some of these courses will be the subject of in person lectures. 

## How to Use

Courses are given a numerical code - the prefix to the course. Prefixes group similar courses together. Some courses will have an additional 99 prefix before their code. These describe highly advanced courses that need a lot of background information to properly cover.
